<div class="wrapper">
    <p class="intro"> A lion is considered to be the <strong>king</strong> of the jungle. His roars inject fear into his preys. 
        This gesture is similar to my confidence. The type of confidence that 
        does not go unnotice because it is too loud to be simple. The type of confidence that 
        makes an impact, the type of confidence that enables me to walk into a strange land 
        and return as a native of that land. Because I am fearless and bears the heart of a lion. 
        A lion roars to remind himself that he is powerful. Like everyone who lives and breathe there
        are bright and dark days. Days where my confidence appears to be fading. Whenever I feel 
        as though this is true I roar. I roar to remind myself of who I am. I look myself 
        in the mirror and I say to myself. You have made it this far on your own, you can finish the race. 
        You are worth it, you deserve this, do not give up on yourself, you owe yourself this much.
        <em>I am a Lion</em>.
